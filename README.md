# Airline Flight Delays

This is my walkthrough of the airline delays example from [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) using a Bayesian workflow and implemented with [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/getting_started.html). Each part of the work flow is its own notebook:
