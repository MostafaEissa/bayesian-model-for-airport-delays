# Airline Flight Delays

This is my walkthrough of the airline delays example from [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) using a Bayesian workflow and implemented with [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/getting_started.html). Each part of the work flow is its own notebook:

1. [Getting Started](./notebooks/00.getting-started.ipynb)
2. [Getting Data](./notebooks/01.getting-data.ipynb)
3. [Building Model](./notebooks/02.building-model.ipynb)
